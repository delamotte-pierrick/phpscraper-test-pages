    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following last weeks &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/neat-indie-projects-no.-1/&quot;&gt;‚Äúfirst edition‚Äú of neat indie projects&lt;/a&gt; here are some more interesting indie projects. I&#39;ve discovered these projects in the last week mostly. If you got any feedback for the list or want to leave the makers behind the project a comment reply to this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/spekulatius1984/status/1145240635105898496&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; please. Let&#39;s get started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‚ÄúTrackThis.Link‚Äú ‚Äî Mess around with analytics data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t like being tracked around the web? Sick off having everything tailored to look nice to you? Firefox has built something for you: &lt;a href=&quot;https://trackthis.link/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;TrackThis.Link&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äî a site opening sets of sites aiming to distract the trackers. By messing with the collected data you can add a little salt to their soup. Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mschf.xyz/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;Daniel Greenberg&lt;/a&gt; for building this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Data nerds should check out ‚Äúkyso‚Äú!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m easily excited when seeing interesting and well-presented statistics and data-sets. You could think I&#39;m a bit a data nerd. &lt;a href=&quot;https://kyso.io/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;Kyso&lt;/a&gt; is presenting user-submitted data sets from different sources in a visually pleasing way. Usually, these presentations contain charts and some context to analyze the data. For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://kyso.io/eoin/product-hunt?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;‚ÄúProduct Hunt Voting Distributions‚Äú&lt;/a&gt; is an interesting data set for indie hackers. It would be great if you could suggest and discuss data-sets / research ideas on a public board on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https://eoinmurray.eu/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;Eoin Murray&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/helenadm&quot;&gt;Helena Domo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/KyleOS92&quot;&gt;Kyle O&#39;Shea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‚ÄúDarkmode.js‚Äú ‚Äî Darkmode as a JavaScript Library&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to add dark-mode on your website, but can&#39;t be bothered defining (and maintaining) more CSS? You don&#39;t need to if you using a blend-mode. If you interested in the details check this blog post I&#39;ve found a few weeks ago already: &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.wgao19.cc/sun-moon-blending-mode/&quot;&gt;‚ÄúNight Mode with Mix Blend Mode: Difference‚Äú&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The library is open source &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sandoche/Darkmode.js&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;github.com/sandoche/Darkmode.js&lt;/a&gt; and can be included using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sandoche/Darkmode.js#-how-to-use&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;little JS snippet&lt;/a&gt; only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see some examples on &lt;a href=&quot;https://tradivegan.com/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;tradivegan.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://what.toeat.in/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;what to eat in&lt;/a&gt; and on the developer&#39;s website &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sandoche.com/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;sandoche.com&lt;/a&gt; of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting notifications under control with ‚Äúnotyfy‚Äú&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notifications can be annoying, but they can also be useful to keep track of conversations and posts. Unfortunately, too many companies use notifications to pull you back onto their websites and drag you to their addictive, infinite-scroll timelines. Costing you mental bandwidth every time you just want to read a message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://notyfy.co/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;Notyfy&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/zwacky&quot;&gt;Simon&lt;/a&gt; allows you to see and manage the notifications from multiple sites aggregated in one place. All information is displayed in your browser instead of another website. You can click through to the content you getting notified about. At the moment Facebook, Reddit, Gmail, StackOverflow, Medium, Quora and LinkedIn are supported. Marking notifications as read works on Facebook, Reddit, and Gmail only for now. More sites and features are in work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Confused by all the details in Google Analytics? Check out ‚ÄúFlatGA‚Äú&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Analytics is as powerful as it&#39;s confusing. Information overload from start to end with numerous charts, reports, and many tables. Especially if you are running your first website and want to learn more the overload can be challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kambanthemaker.com/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;Kamban the maker&lt;/a&gt; has built a neat tool for exactly this case: &lt;a href=&quot;https://flatga.io/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;FlatGA ‚Äî a simple dashboard for Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt;. It started off from own pain to becoming a great tool to get a quick understanding of your visitors. The application connects to your Google Analytics and presents all information in a well-organized dashboard. No information is stored as the data is loaded from Google in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‚ÄúBiscuit‚Äú-Browser: A tasty alternative&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a fan of cookies, I had to look at what this was and it turned out to be an alternative browser. &lt;a href=&quot;https://eatbiscuit.com/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;Biscuit is a privacy-focused browser&lt;/a&gt; trying to relieve you from the flood of tabs. Under the hood, it runs Chromium as a browser-engine. The most common tools are listed in a customizable sidebar as well as over a tab menu. Definitely an interesting concept for heavy users. As it&#39;s Chromium-based a migration from Chrome should be pain-free. There are several different operating systems supported - find the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/agata/dl.biscuit/releases/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Biscuit download here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‚Äúeyetato‚Äú ‚Äî Where on my site are my users looking at?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (2020-08-24):&lt;/strong&gt; Link removed as the site is offline ‚úùÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A question many developers have asked themselves before: where do my users look at? What catches the attention of my visitors and users? By nature a tricky question to answer. It has usually been answered using eye-tracking done using a camera filming the users while interacting with your product or visiting your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eyetato by &lt;a href=&quot;http://mortenjust.com/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;Morten Just&lt;/a&gt; allows you to get the same information, without actually using eye-tracking software and camera. The heat-map is generated using a machine learning algorithm trained using real eye-tracking data. As it&#39;s a prediction, you should use the data carefully. Spending one minute on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-mF7mMJnQk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;demo video&lt;/a&gt; is definitely worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Still unsure what colors to use? Check ‚Äúculrs‚Äú!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know, there is no second chance for a first impression. Finding the right color scheme for your project is as important as having the right name. Check &lt;a href=&quot;https://culrs.com/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;culrs.com&lt;/a&gt; if you need some inspiration for the right colors for your next side-project. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mshra_ji&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Rupak Mishra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/iamarnob6543&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Arnob Mukherjee&lt;/a&gt; have curated a lot of different color schemes for you to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‚Äúsizzy‚Äú ‚Äî Resizing your browser during development finally has an end&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sizzy.co/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;sizzy&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://kitze.io/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;Kitze&lt;/a&gt; is a developer tool (in form of a browser) to allow you viewing your website in a number of resolutions at once. The times when you had to resize your browser constantly or use the mobile mode of your browser one-by-one are over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts üôèÔ∏è&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the following edition of this list of &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/neat-indie-projects-no.-3/&quot;&gt;‚Äúneat indie projects‚Äú here&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Neat Indie Projects No. 3</title>
    <link href="https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/neat-indie-projects-no.-3/"/>
    <updated>2019-07-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/neat-indie-projects-no.-3/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is no. 3! If you haven&#39;t read about the previous projects you might find the &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/neat-indie-projects-no.-1/&quot; title=&quot;First list of neat indie side-projects&quot;&gt;first list of side projects&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/neat-indie-projects-no.-2/&quot; title=&quot;Second list of neat indie side-projects&quot;&gt;second list of side projects&lt;/a&gt; of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you got any feedback for the list or want to leave the makers behind the project a comment reply to this &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/spekulatius1984/status/1147829211090100224&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;, please. Here we go with some neat side projects and their makers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‚ÄúEcosia‚Äú ‚Äî the search-engine that plants trees üå≥Ô∏è&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even you might have heard about Ecosia before I still would like to introduce the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ecosia.org/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;search-engine that plants trees&lt;/a&gt; as climate change is without a doubt very important. Quite similar to Google, Ecosia provides a search-engine with advertising on the top of their search results. The advertising money earned from the search results doesn&#39;t flow to investors though. It flows into selected projects to plant trees and reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. If you can do one little thing to make a positive impact on the environment, switch to Ecosia üå≥Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Green&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Eco-friendly&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Search Engine&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‚ÄúproGramCLI‚Äú ‚Äî a self-hosted, CLI-based Instagram clone ü§≥Ô∏è&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sarthology.github.io/proGramCLI/&quot;&gt;proGramCLI&lt;/a&gt; is a self-hosted, CLI-based Instagram clone by Sarthak Sharma. Privacy is important and especially when it comes to your close friends and family. A self-hosted version gives you more control over who sees your photos and videos. If you don&#39;t want Zuck and friends see everything you share and type this is your way forward. It&#39;s naturally open source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sarthology/proGramCLI&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;sarthology/proGramCLI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Instagram&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Privacy&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;electron&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

--&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‚Äúcurlx‚Äú ‚Äî if cURL and Postman had a baby üë∂&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a developer, I&#39;m often checking if APIs work as expected and serve my purpose. Even there are graphical programs such as Postman, I somehow end up at the command-line often. curl is my tool of choice then. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://curlx.dev/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;curlx&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.shivkanth.com/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;Shivkanth Bagavathy&lt;/a&gt; has built a tool for those who like to explore APIs on their command-line. You can see headers as well as formatted responses directly on your bash. It also comes with a list of previous requests (history) and the option to manage your requests in collections. As to expect, it&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/shivkanthb/curlx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;open sourced on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Open source&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Command-line&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bash&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

--&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‚ÄúWavenet for Chrome‚Äú ‚Äî syndicate any marked text into sound&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wavenet-for-chrome/iefankigbnlnlaolflbcopliocibkffc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wavenet for Chrome is a browser extension&lt;/a&gt; to syndicate any marked text into acoustic output. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pgmichael&quot;&gt;Michael Poirier-Ginter&lt;/a&gt; has built a tool which could help people with strong reading deficits as well as visually impaired people. The extension is open source, you find the source code on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pgmichael/wavenet-for-chrome&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the extension is free, Google Cloud comes with a small charge. As with most cloud providers, there is a free tier for new customers. Check the Google cloud offerings for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Open source&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Browser Extension&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Chrome extension&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;‚Äúlazydocker‚Äú ‚Äî the lazier way to manage everything Docker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever used docker you have had your time with the numerous commands and options. Finding out what the current state of your containers is can be annoying as well as challenging when you are new to docker. With &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker&quot;&gt;lazydocker&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jesseduffield&quot;&gt;Jesse Duffield&lt;/a&gt; this gets easier. It shows you containers, images, volumes, etc. on one screen. By selection with the mouse, you can find out more about the state and resources used. &amp;quot;The lazier way to manage everything docker&amp;quot; says Jesse. He has also published a short &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NICqQPxwJWw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; showing the features and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;container&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;serverless&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Docker&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;open source&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

--&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‚ÄúKimai‚Äú ‚Äî self-hosted, open source invoice management web-app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freelancers and entrepreneurs this might be of interest for you. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kimai.org/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;Kimai&lt;/a&gt; is a web-application to track working-hours, manage clients and projects, and generate invoices. These are only some of the various features it comes with. On the website you can find a complete list of features in version 2. You can find information on how to self-host the application using Docker, 1-click installers and even FTP in the documentation. If you are looking for an alternative to Xero or InvoiceNinja this looks like a good option. The software by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kevinpapst.de/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;Kevin Papst&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kevinpapst/kimai2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;open source on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and he supports the development with donations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;PHP&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;open source&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;self-hosted&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;invoicing system&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts üôèÔ∏è&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, if you haven&#39;t seen the previous lists I would recommend having a look. There are some interesting projects included in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/neat-indie-projects-no.-1/&quot; title=&quot;First list of neat indie side-projects&quot;&gt;first list of side projects&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/neat-indie-projects-no.-2/&quot; title=&quot;Second list of neat indie side-projects&quot;&gt;second list of side projects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Neat Side Projects No. 4</title>
    <link href="https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/neat-side-projects-no.-4/"/>
    <updated>2019-07-14T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/neat-side-projects-no.-4/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#39;s edition will be briefer as I&#39;m on a visa-run in Penang (Malaysia). I&#39;m actually writing this from the public bus to the airport. I still got more than enough interesting side projects for you to check out. This time with these projects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is my website ready for launching? Find out with websitelaunchchecklist.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‚ÄúClose my tabs‚Äú to manage your tabs smarter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‚Äúmetomic‚Äú - a smart GDPR consent manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‚ÄúNetflixHangouts‚Äú to watch Netlify at work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See how you move around your town using your Google data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read faster with this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open source library to securely share files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As every week: if you got any feedback please get &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/contact/&quot;&gt;in touch&lt;/a&gt;. Let&#39;s get started with some neat side-projects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Make sure your website is ready to launch with websitelaunchchecklist.com&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning on launching a new site soon? Check you &lt;a href=&quot;https://websitelaunchchecklist.com/?ref=peterthaleikis.com&quot;&gt;WebsiteLaunchChecklist.com&lt;/a&gt; for the top things you should tick off before you launching officially. You can tick off the items on the website and clear your data later for the next project. By &lt;a href=&quot;https://boag.online/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;Fraser Boag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ready to launch?&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Checklist&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Drowning in tabs? ‚ÄúClose my tabs‚Äú can help!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having too much going on in your browser and getting unproductive over the number of open tabs? ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/close-my-tabs&quot;&gt;Close my tabs&lt;/a&gt;‚Äú by &lt;a href=&quot;https://kambanthemaker.com/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;Kamban the Maker&lt;/a&gt; can help you to get it back under control. It allows you to select and close tabs by the last-access time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Productivity&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Browser extension&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;‚Äúmetomic‚Äú - A smart GDPR consent manager&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m sure everyone has seen the cookie warnings and banners on several occasions. Richard Vibert and his team have built a smart consent manager for websites.

&lt;h3&gt;Watching Netflix at work? Check ‚ÄúNetflixHangouts‚Äú&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuck in 9-5 and can&#39;t get out? &lt;a href=&quot;https://netflixhangouts.com/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;NetflixHangouts.com&lt;/a&gt; changes the looks of your Netflix into a site looking like a Google Hangouts meeting call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Netlify&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Hangouts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;See how you move around your town using your Google data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jacopofarina.eu/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;Jacopo Farina&lt;/a&gt; has built a side-project to visualize your location data as a heatmap. The data used is coming from what Google already collected about you. This requires to be tech-savvy and basic knowledge of Python doesn&#39;t hurt. The project source code is licensed as open source and can be found on GitHub under &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jacopofar/location-data-to-heatmap&quot;&gt;jacopofar/location-data-to-heatmap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Location data&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Mapping&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Open Source&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Read faster&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you just start out with reading it can be time-consuming. Even many seasoned readers are able to increase their reading speed by leaving out words or jumping sentences. One of the more simple methods is jumping from word to word faster. By displaying only one word at the time, giving it a predefined time and jumping to the next word automatically you can increase your reading speed significantly. This what &lt;a href=&quot;http://readshitfaster.com/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;read shit faster&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sakofchit&quot;&gt;Sakun&lt;/a&gt; does. You paste any text, set your speed and off you got to read the text at a much faster pace. It might take a few tries to get the pace right, but definitely worth a try, if you are reading a quite a bit. There is also an &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/read-shit-faster/hgbjcpbdcekffgenjkfleejmpgaaleij&quot;&gt;extension for Chrome available&lt;/a&gt; by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Productivity&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Reading&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;File sharing for devs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you got asked for a screenshot or the latest version of that file again? Emailing files or sending them via a messenger was a constant task before Google Docs. By now the issue is less painful, but the basic problem remains: how do I send a file fast and temporary without going to a website and uploading it manually? &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/schollz/share&quot;&gt;‚ÄúShare‚Äú&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://schollz.com/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;Zack Scholl&lt;/a&gt; is an open source library which allows you to securely share files directly from your command line. After installation simply run &lt;code&gt;share filename.abc&lt;/code&gt; and get a download link directly, without accessing any websites. Files are kept depending on the file size ‚Äî the larger the file the short it will be kept. Paths are permanent as the file hash is used as URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;File Sharing&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Developer Tools&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Are your browser extensions safe?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browser extensions have by nature more access to your data. Often the permissions are granted without much thinking and malicious extensions might end up collecting and sending your personal data off. To avoid this you use &lt;a href=&quot;https://extensionmonitor.com/?ref=PeterThaleikis&quot;&gt;extension monitor&lt;/a&gt; to keep an eye on the extensions and weed out bad extensions quicker. More details can be found in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://extensionmonitor.com/blog/introducing-extension-monitor?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s a platform providing you a background screening of installed extensions. Currently, the aim seems more big companies and government organizations but a customer-focused version of this project would be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Browser Extensions&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Privacy&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Security&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing words&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Neat Side Projects No. 5</title>
    <link href="https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/neat-side-projects-no.-5/"/>
    <updated>2019-07-21T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/neat-side-projects-no.-5/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With starting this list I&#39;ve begun to collect more and more ideas. Whenever I find something interesting I put it in my notes and select some interesting side project ideas and projects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help others accessing the Tor Network using the ‚ÄúSnowflake‚Äú extension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make your website faster by pre-fetching content while idling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do keywords research where you search ‚Äî on your search engine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make your website screenshots look like a browser for free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell your story in form of a comic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earn money with users solving captchas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As every week: if you got any feedback please get &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/contact/&quot;&gt;in touch&lt;/a&gt;. Let&#39;s get started with some neat side-projects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Help others accessing the Tor Network using the ‚ÄúSnowflake‚Äú extension&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tor Project has published an extension which allows you to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/snowflake/mafpmfcccpbjnhfhjnllmmalhifmlcie&quot;&gt;your browser as a Tor-node called ‚ÄúSnowflake‚Äú&lt;/a&gt;. This way you can share your (hopefully) less censored internet access with people in countries which have only a strongly censored internet access. You don&#39;t need to worry about things others do as your browser will not become an exit-node. It becomes only a regular node. The extension can be turned on and off easily and shows some stats as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This extension isn&#39;t a tool to access the internet freely, it&#39;s for contributors to the network. To access the internet freely without censorship you need to use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.torproject.org/download&quot;&gt;Tor Browser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Make your website faster by pre-fetching content while the browser is idle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/quicklink&quot;&gt;QuickLink&lt;/a&gt; is a library published and maintained by Google&#39;s Chrome Labs. It allows you to pre-fetch content while the browser is idle. Links in viewport are pre-fetched, if the user isn&#39;t on a slow internet connections or data-saver mode on. The library is very small with less than 1 KB file size. More information on the options and required installation steps are on the GitHub repo linked at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Do keywords research where you search&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve started learning more about SEO a while ago. It&#39;s tricky at times, as you can&#39;t verify your results immediately. But decent information definitely helps along the way. Yesterday, I&#39;ve stumbled across &lt;a href=&quot;https://keywordseverywhere.com/&quot;&gt;Keywords Everywhere&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s a Firefox &amp;amp; Chrome extension showing you keyword volumes while searching as well as alternatives in a box next to your search results. Pretty handy, if you are planning to write an article and want to know if there is an alternative word or phrase for something and you end up discovering even more keywords and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update (2019-12-11): This project is now a paid service. The keyword data itself is still free, but the volume information is only provided once you purchased credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Make your website screenshots look like a browser for free using ‚ÄúBrowserFrame‚Äú&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://browserframe.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BrowserFrame.com&lt;/a&gt; is a free online tool to wrap your screenshots or URLs into browser-frames. This way, you can explain your SaaS or websites better on websites or in PDFs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tell your story in form of a comic using ‚ÄúStoryTeller‚Äú&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Communicating your side project idea can be challenging. No one likes websites filled with lots of texts. Visual elements are the way to go. Most people opt for an explainer video to explain more complex topics, but this wave seems to slow down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting alternative might be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://storyteller.launchaco.com/&quot;&gt;‚ÄúStoryTeller‚Äú&lt;/a&gt; tool. It allows you to create a comic based on uploaded images and add speech bubbles to tell your story. The project is in pre-launch, but it might be worth to follow if you are planning to launch a new project soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Earn money with Captchas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day we select traffic lights, motorbikes and more for Google. The benefit for the webmasters are a verification that the accessing computer is controlled by an actual human. The bigger benefits arises for Google: labeling their photos for AI and machine learning. In a nutshell: We are doing unpaid work for Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not using this work done by users on your website to label data for paying clients? This is the approach &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hcaptcha.com/&quot;&gt;hCaptcha&lt;/a&gt; is taking. You can drop in hcaptcha as a replacement for the Recaptcha service and earn money by solving captchas. Machine learning companies can get their sets labeled easier and you as webmaster have another revenue source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing words&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Neat Side Projects No. 6</title>
    <link href="https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/neat-side-projects-no.-6/"/>
    <updated>2019-07-28T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/neat-side-projects-no.-6/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weeks edition is a bit shorter as I&#39;m preparing to go to Europe in a few days. The upcoming trip will probably require some more flexibility on the publishing side of this weekly side-project list. I haven&#39;t planned everything through so I&#39;m not sure how it will work out. Naturally, there are also other responsibilities along I need to keep up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Devlids is collecting art-work from developer laptops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‚ÄúNo CS Degree‚Äú: Interviews with people, who got into IT without a computer science degree&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stylish and informative status-pages with supstatus.com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jump into writing straight away with ‚ÄúNew Tab Draft‚Äú&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‚ÄúCube.JS‚Äú is using a different approach to visualizing data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‚ÄúDesktop‚Äú is a desktop client for GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To share any feedback please get &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/contact/&quot;&gt;in touch&lt;/a&gt;. Let&#39;s get started with some neat side-projects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Devlids is a project collecting art-work from dev-laptops&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people working in IT decorate their laptops with stickers they get at meetups and conferences. These stickers range from funny works of art, icons, emojis to known project they either prefer to work with or are simply &amp;quot;sexy&amp;quot;. Developers are known to decorate. &lt;a href=&quot;https://devlids.com/?ref=peterthaleikis.com&quot;&gt;Devlids&lt;/a&gt; is collecting these sticker-collections. You can browse through and see whos laptop is behind each of them. If you like to, you can also submit your laptop lid to the collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Interviews with people who got into IT without a computer science degree&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineering jobs don&#39;t need a degree really. More than a degree, it needs commitment and love to what you are doing. That holds up for many jobs (but not all). As more and more companies realize this they drop their requirement to have an engineering or computer science degree for their jobs. This opens the doors for many self-taught developers like myself. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/petecodes&quot;&gt;Pete&lt;/a&gt; has started &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nocsdegree.com/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;‚ÄúNo CS Degree‚Äú&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s a website featuring the stories of self-taught developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Don&#39;t want to be unprepared in case your site goes down? Check supstatus.com!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many things can take your website down, some are in your power to address while others aren&#39;t. In either case, if you are running a professional website you want to prepared. Why? Quite simply: When your site goes down your visitors and users will turn to Google and find websites where people talk about your website being offline, speculate reasons and more. You want to have an authority place to communicate what is going on. Naturally, you need to communicate and establish this authority place beforehand. &lt;a href=&quot;https://supstatus.com/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;supstatus status-pages&lt;/a&gt; gives you exactly this. You can set up your uptime tracking and post information about the current state if needed. All running as sub-domain under your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Start writing straight away with &amp;quot;New Tab Draft&amp;quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I just want to write down some thoughts down quickly. It might be an outline for an article I want to write, an idea I want to outline briefly or just store something for a moment to not lose my clipboard. &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-draft/nmfjkeiebceinkbggliapgfdjphocpdh&quot;&gt;New Tab Draft&lt;/a&gt; allows you all of this in your new tab. All information is stored locally to protect your privacy. Unfortunately, there is no Firefox version as far as I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Visualizing data with a different approach&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, you would visualize data by writing some sort of data loader, process it if needed and hand it over to a JavaScript library. &lt;a href=&quot;https://cube.dev/?ref=PeterThaleikis&quot;&gt;Cube JS&lt;/a&gt; is taking it a bit differently. It allows you to bring it all together by let the rendering library access the database directly and process the data into the needed format to get it ready for display. The source code is published under MIT license on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/cube-js/cube.js&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. A handy tool to &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/what-is-an-open-statistics-page-and-why-you-should-have-one/&quot; title=&quot;What is an open statistics page and why you should have one?&quot;&gt;build an open statistics page&lt;/a&gt; for your indie side-project by the way. Once I get some time I&#39;ll try it out for the search data collected by startup name check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Desktop client for GitHub&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, &lt;a href=&quot;https://desktop.github.com/&quot;&gt;Desktop&lt;/a&gt; is a desktop client for GitHub. It allows you to perform the most common tasks you would normally do on the GitHub website but using a desktop application. Without having tried it (as there isn&#39;t a version for Linux yet), I would hope this saves you time loading time. Currently, the software is available for Windows and Mac only. Hopefully, a Linux version will be released soon. It is, of course, open-source and the source code is available on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing words&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Indie Hackers: Should I Build My Side-project / Small Business in Public?</title>
    <link href="https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/indie-hackers:-should-i-build-my-side-project-small-business-in-public/"/>
    <updated>2019-10-28T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/indie-hackers:-should-i-build-my-side-project-small-business-in-public/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You have had a great idea, spent some time &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/business-idea-validation&quot;&gt;validating your business idea&lt;/a&gt; and are now facing the next questions: How should I approach building it? One of the most used buzzwords in the indie hacker space is ‚Äúbuilding in public‚Äú. It comes in different styles and with different methods. Of course, success in building a side-project publicly also varies. I aim to provide a starting point in this article with a look at methods, platforms, and tools. This blog-post links into the series on introduction in the indie hacker space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Is Building a Business in Public?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of an official description of the term, I would describe it as &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Any public work on a project aimed to improve, get feedback, build trust and/or attract potential interests&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;. The public part can be live as it happens or later, in the form of in-depth blog posts. As with most things, there is no ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù and you have got to choose what works for you and your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big questions with public building at the moment are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does building in public still give you an advantage in promoting your side-project or startup?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you need to get started and what does it take to be successful?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are easy ways of building a company publicly? What options are more for advanced businesses?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is starting a business in public going to look in the future?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Build in Public?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of building in public isn&#39;t entirely new. Many people opt to &amp;quot;build in public&amp;quot; and some good reasons speak for it. If done well, it can drive quite a lot of attention to your project while building up trust in your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You naturally stay more accountable to your idea and project. Continuously dropped project ideas leave you in a bad light.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also you are building up a brand for your work and workstyle. Once people recognize your consistent high-quality work you are building up trust. Same goes the other way: if you are putting together a sloppy solution and present it as a masterpiece people will notice. You will get called out for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great example of building a project in public is Ethan&#39;s work &lt;a href=&quot;https://kanbanmail.app/&quot;&gt;on Kanban Mail&lt;/a&gt;. He completely built and designed his email client in public. You can read more on his &lt;a href=&quot;https://ethan.link/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Methods of Building in Public&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ways to build a bootstrapped business in public vary, naturally. Some are more advanced and time-intensive (live streaming) whereas blogging gives you an easy start and is scalable over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Blogging about It&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest versions of ‚Äúbuilding in public‚Äù were probably the engineering blogs maintained by some bigger companies. With the Internet changing, it&#39;s hard to say who started it. Blogging is still a valuable and under-recognized tool. Content marketing, blogging, and guest posts on other blogs are an important part in most marketing strategies. It&#39;s building not only an online reputation, but awareness of your project and backlinks. It&#39;s also driving transparency and trust. &lt;a href=&quot;http://open.buffer.com/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;Buffer&lt;/a&gt; is a very good example of a company maintaining an awesome public company blog and working on the previously mentioned points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, WordPress has become quite dated when it comes to blogs. &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/introduction-to-static-site-generators/&quot;&gt;Static Site Generators&lt;/a&gt; make the tech-side of running your own blog very simple now. An easy starting point for a new blog is, for example, a Netlify-hosted copy of &lt;a href=&quot;https://hylia.website/?ref=PeterThaleikis.com&quot;&gt;Hylia Website&lt;/a&gt;. If you don&#39;t have the right domain researched yet, I recommend you check your desired domain names - using my little &lt;a href=&quot;https://startupnamecheck.com/&quot;&gt;name checking tool&lt;/a&gt; of course ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How Much Time Do I Need to Run a Company/Startup Blog?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is naturally a tricky question to answer. The time demand to run a blog depends on your own expectations and goals. If you drive marketing for your project blog on a daily basis and publish very frequently, this can quickly become time consuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A solid middle ground might be 1-4 posts per month and shared on social media. This ensures you get some exposure, capture some of the low-hanging SEO fruit and learn marketing basics along the way. One year of consistent blogging with this approach should put you in front of many others, who barely blog or don&#39;t use a blog at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to push it more you can actively work for backlinks. Work towards publishing one guest post on a topic-related blog per month. This requires some time to research suitable blogs, agree on a topic with the lead writer or editor of the blog, and write &amp;amp; edit the article. This is generally an underestimated task but definitely worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sharing Data and Statistics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fairly simple and good way is sharing statistics of your business with the public. Some people are keen to look behind the public facade of a company and look at the business in numbers. Warren Buffett is known to study annual reports intensively and draw conclusions from the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new trend in small business is going a similar way by sharing statistics and data widely. No law or public listing requires this for small and medium companies. It&#39;s an easy way to gain trust and more chances for businesses to discuss what they do in public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For independent small businesses, this is often done as part of an &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/what-is-an-open-statistics-page-and-why-you-should-have-one/&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;open page&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. If you&#39;re unfamiliar with the idea behind this: It&#39;s a freely accessible web-page aimed at sharing basic information about a side-project or small business. Some examples are &lt;a href=&quot;https://nomadlist.com/open&quot;&gt;Nomadlist&#39;s open page&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kanbanmail.app/open&quot;&gt;Kanban Mail&#39;s open page&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://wip.chat/open&quot;&gt;WIP Chat&#39;s Open page&lt;/a&gt;. Previously mentioned, Buffer maintains a complete blog for transparency (linked above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Live Streaming Your Startup Build&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live streaming sessions are quite popular. These often contain a mix between coding and talking. Most people talk about their projects, development steps, and reasoning. This being said, there is no need to stream coding sessions only. You could also talk about marketing approaches, writing of emails, invite people and have chats about UX enhancements, etc. The limit is really your creativity and time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How to Set up Your Computer for Live Stream&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tech is getting easier than it was. There are still a few steps included in getting ready. When the 24 hours startup challenge ran, Pat, Armin, and Melanie prepared a &lt;a href=&quot;https://24hrstartup.com/b/recommended-twitch-streaming-setup-guide&quot;&gt;handy setup guide for Twitch&lt;/a&gt; as it&#39;s a little more effort getting everything started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Where to Live Stream&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More and more platforms allow live streaming, including Twitter and &lt;a href=&quot;https://whichlogin.com/facebook/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. But live streams for IndieHackers don&#39;t seem to stick there. Post-production is often done by uploading the stream on YouTube and adding more meta information around the video. People searching on YouTube won&#39;t find you only by the words spoken in the videos. The description is your place to make sure you are found. So don&#39;t forget to include a decent description with links to your personal blog and side-project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t expect hundreds to follow your live stream from the very beginning. But some people might jump in and see what you are up to. &lt;a href=&quot;https://shipstreams.com/&quot;&gt;Shipstreams&lt;/a&gt; helps to draw some attention to your stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Maker Communities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building in public and maker communities go hand in hand. They&#39;re your public forum and support group. Have you got a question? Put it in the chat or post a question on the board. Want to get some feedback? Post it. With every post and question, you are becoming more a member of these communities. The community will support you when you launch your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any community, just coming around to share your links won&#39;t get you much love. You should spend some time with other members: talk, discuss issues, and work together on your individual projects. Start with reading, commenting, then ask for feedback and last but not least, present your project. A good general guideline can be found in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/getting-started-on-indiehackers/&quot;&gt;intro article for IndieHackers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most popular communities are &lt;a href=&quot;https://getmakerlog.com/&quot;&gt;Makerlog&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://wip.chat/&quot;&gt;WIP.chat&lt;/a&gt; in 2019. Pick one to your liking and go with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future of Building in Public&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building in public is here to stay. The methods, tools, and platforms will probably change in the coming years, but the concept will remain. Simply because it&#39;s building on what is scarce: authenticity and transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Building a Startup &amp;quot;One Tool at the Time&amp;quot;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new approach partially related to building in public is the &amp;quot;one tool at the time&amp;quot; idea. I&#39;ve started doing more little tools and projects. Each of them is solving an independent small problem and gets launched as a separate project under a separate name. I noticed this first with Shopify&#39;s business name generator. It&#39;s a tool in itself; not part of Shopify&#39;s product directly, but it&#39;s supporting. And as part of this, it gained a number of backlinks and users being exposed to the Shopify idea and brand. If you are a software engineer yourself, spinning up little tools should come easy, relieving from the &amp;quot;one big project&amp;quot;. If you are planning to outsource your development, you should plan ahead and use the partial projects as milestones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One tool at a time is a neat approach for people bootstrapping small businesses, as it splits the risks and work-load naturally into smaller chunks. I see this becoming part of the process for suitable projects in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More Virtual Assistants to Facilitate&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone&#39;s time is limited to 24 hours a day. Most people like to sleep, eat and have some time for themselves. This reduces the available work hours. If you are working 9-5 it&#39;s even worse. To achieve more, you can either work smarter or hire someone to work with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a fair price, you get another 10-40 hours of work and the results from this work. These additional hours are of great use to process videos, proof-read texts, write descriptions, etc. Every step of your work you hand over to someone reliable helps your public building as it frees you to focus on growing your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find good people in the Philippines working from $3/hour upwards. That&#39;s only around 500 USD per month for a full-time assistant. Of course, this won&#39;t work if you are doing an (almost) zero-budget project. Either way, I see hiring Virtual Assistants (VAs) becoming more and more a thing. It switches you from working in your business to working on your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Smarter Leveraging of Your Resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have different resources at our disposal. Working smarter means knowing how to use one sort of resource (time, money, education, knowledge, network) to obtain more of another resource. Using a VA is one way to turn money into time but there are others too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have time on your hands it&#39;s a good idea to learn to code, ask great questions, write content, design or spend time thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve got money, you should do the opposite. Buy the things that either efficiently save you time or allow you to progress faster. That could be a tool or hiring someone to build, design or write something for you. You can find all kind of virtual assistants (VA), writers, proof-readers, etc. on platforms such (https://peterthaleikis.com/freelancer)[Freelancer.com] and (https://peterthaleikis.com/peopleperhour)[PeoplePerHour].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve got a great network, make use of it. Connect people to gain money or favors and build your business from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even challenges and problems are a type of resource. Nothing helps with personal growth and coming up with new ideas as do your personal challenges. Make sure you spend the required time &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/how-to-make-your-time-worthwhile-when-building-a-startup-or-side-project-bp1829yj&quot;&gt;validating these ideas&lt;/a&gt; before jumping into action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might sound logical, but it‚Äôs not one of the things many people actually live by. For public building this is an important aspect. It shows your followers that you think problems through and find solutions outside of the box. This will make the difference between you and hundreds of other makers who just document their hard work.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Deep Dive into Validating Your Business Ideas</title>
    <link href="https://peterthaleikis.com/business-idea-validation/"/>
    <updated>2019-12-09T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://peterthaleikis.com/business-idea-validation/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/betancourtfit&quot;&gt;Juan Betancourt&lt;/a&gt; you can read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@betancourt/c%C3%B3mo-validar-tus-ideas-de-negocio-r%C3%A1pido-y-sin-dejar-tu-trabajo-688acf747538&quot;&gt;article in Spanish&lt;/a&gt; as well now üòçÔ∏è&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When sudden inspiration strikes you, nothing is better than getting started building your next project straight away and not losing momentum. After all, no story of genius-inventors talks about due diligence and planning. However, this might be exactly what you need to look at to avoid ending up with your startup or project, like roughly half of all new businesses, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fundera.com/blog/what-percentage-of-small-businesses-fail&quot;&gt;fail within the first five years&lt;/a&gt; and end up on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.failory.com/cemetery/&quot;&gt;Startup Cemetry&lt;/a&gt;. To use Benjamin Franklin&#39;s words: &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúBy failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why bother spending time to validate your idea properly?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning isn‚Äôt the most exciting task, especially at the beginning of the adventure of building a company. But Reason speaks for it spending time validating your idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seldom does one start a company from a point of plenty of time and money. More likely you are bootstrapping your business and financing it yourself or even using a small business loan. A new project naturally costs time and money - the two things you haven‚Äôt got a lot of. Planning ahead and finding out if a project is actually viable can make or break your young business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are starting without any preparation or a plan, you are at a much higher risk of losing motivation along the way. This can come from many reasons at the end. Three very common issues are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scope: Underestimating the required time to build the minimum viable product (MVP) and later the full project are very common. It usually starts with &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs super simple; I can do this in a weekend‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; and ends after a month of aimless building. Defining a clear scope, knowing what it needs to be useful, helps a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competition: Even before you launch, your competition might manage to stop you. How? Pretty simple: If you start building your project without preparation you will come to the point of deciding on a name sooner or later. This is the moment where you head to your domain registrar, type in your wish name and find it registered. Registered by a business doing what you started building. The same might happen for several domain names. It‚Äôs without any doubt quite demotivating to constantly discover new competitors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marketing: If the two previous points don‚Äôt grind your side project or new business to a stop, it‚Äôs often marketing. After the project is done and the baby has a name, you are facing the hard reality that &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúIf I build it, they will come‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; is working only in very rare cases and in fairy tales. Marketing requires daily work to get your project into the hands of the people who might profit from it and become your customers. The graveyard of completed, but not marketed online-projects speaks a clear language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Validating your idea ahead of building anything also provides you with valuable information you can use in marketing later on. You have read about the issues, you know who is struggling who, you know the sites your target group spends time on. This will pay off later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all comes down to this: Uncertainty is what you have plenty of in a young business. Your ‚Äújob‚Äù as a business owner is to turn &lt;em&gt;‚ÄòUncertainty‚Äô&lt;/em&gt; into &lt;em&gt;‚ÄòCertainty‚Äô&lt;/em&gt;, to ensure your company is still successful after five years. Validating your business idea proper is the first step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step-by-step guide to validating your business idea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet is full of information on how to get your project idea checked and validated. However, there are many more ways than just Google to find out if someone has already built your idea or considered and decided to abandon your latest idea. It‚Äôs all a question of finding the right information and evaluating it in the context of your idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get started with brainstorming terms, keywords and potential names for your project. It helps to keep a Google Sheet for this. This article comes with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L924MDRqCwQVHjfp38vDnRbB1sgzA9jglGdrxoE7d5c/edit?usp%3Dsharing&quot;&gt;sheet template&lt;/a&gt; for this case. Feel free to use it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ubersuggest.io/&quot;&gt;UberSuggest&lt;/a&gt; is a simple tool to get more ideas for keywords and other related terms. If your list is very short at this point it helps to write a short description of the key features and unique selling points (what makes it different from existing projects) - this is often called an elevator pitch. This way you should find more keywords/phrases describing your idea. Collect all of them in the sheet. We will weed the terms out as we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following list is naturally not conclusive as there are many niche websites and communities you can consult, but it should be fairly comprehensive to get started. It contains a list of websites and platforms you can check to see if your idea has been built, discussed or launched. Generally, I recommend to check each of your terms on these platforms. After a few websites you will get a feeling for which ones aren‚Äôt giving you any results and you might want to leave them out for future searches. But you can also pick some promising platforms if you are only after a first impression at this point. Let‚Äôs get started validating your idea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely one of the first things that comes to mind is searching on Google. Besides similar projects what is interesting is really the kind of results you find when you search for your keywords. Do you find articles on popular platforms or niche blogs? Are these ‚Äúhow-to‚Äù articles? Are there older or newer discussion forums? Are the developer blogs discussing solutions for your problem? Are there blog posts by potential users/customers discussing their manual approach and solution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Google, YouTube is the world‚Äôs second biggest search engine. Are there videos around this topic? Keep an eye on how many times the videos have been watched. What kind of comments are below the videos? Are the comments speaking of excitement or rather on the negative end of the spectrum? Are people mentioning service or tool in the comments related to your idea? If so, add them to your ‚ÄúCompetitors‚Äù list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unknown to many, Facebook is one of the top 3 search engines worldwide. Put some of your keywords and key-phrases into Facebook. Make use of the filter bar on top and focus on ‚ÄúGroups‚Äù, ‚ÄúPages‚Äù, and ‚ÄúPosts‚Äù. Depending on your idea, the ‚ÄúEvents‚Äù, ‚ÄúMarketplace‚Äù and ‚ÄúApp‚Äù can also be very useful. Especially groups are interesting, check the metrics members as well as the activity. Look out for significant problems people discuss. Does your idea address these? If so, very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are people seeking help with the problem you are planning to address? Check Quora for questions relating to the idea. Take note of the related topics and browse the questions listed under these topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search jump on Twitter next. Look out for accounts dedicated to the project. Are there tweets about this? Are people complaining about the problem you are looking to solve? What are the responses? Do people point to a simple solution?Are there commonly used hashtags for your idea? Add them to the ‚ÄúSpaces &amp;amp; Links‚Äù list in your template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reddit is a platform used in various ways. Type in some of your successful terms, but don‚Äôt leave it at this. Search also for some unpopular terms - Reddit has a lot of niche communities (so-called ‚Äúreddits‚Äù). Take note of any reddits related to your idea and add them to your list of communities (called ‚ÄúSpaces &amp;amp; Links‚Äù in the provided template).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identify what people are connecting with your idea by using &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/answerthepublic&quot;&gt;Answer The Public&lt;/a&gt;. Simply put some of your winning terms in and keep especially an eye on the questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search for articles on &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;. Are there long articles on how to deal with problem? Take note of the people who wrote the articles. Add them to your list of people in the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check for projects on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.upwork.com/&quot;&gt;Upwork&lt;/a&gt;. Are people posting regular projects addressing your problem? Look for bundled up packages solving your problem on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiverr.com/&quot;&gt;Fiverr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peopleperhour.com/&quot;&gt;PeoplePerHour&lt;/a&gt;. Look at the number of purchases and the reviews. If you find listings on Fiverr and PeoplePerHour that‚Äôs a very good sign there is a paying market for your idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Store/b?node=133140011&quot;&gt;Amazon‚Äôs Kindle store&lt;/a&gt;. Search for ebooks about this problem space. Are there any? Are they popular? Look out for bestseller badges. Check out the reviews, especially the more balanced ones (2-4 stars). Also take note of alternative books and links mentioned and add them to your sheet as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are people trying to learn a solution to your problem? Check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udemy.com/&quot;&gt;Udemy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udacity.com/&quot;&gt;Udacity&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.skillshare.com/&quot;&gt;SkillShare&lt;/a&gt;. How are these advertised, as a time saver to reduce long manual processes or to make them much easier? That‚Äôs a good sign. Check metrics such as enrolled students, if available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bootstrapping businesses is trendy. It‚Äôs always a good idea to look on bootstrapping communities like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiehackers.com/&quot;&gt;IndieHackers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.bootstrapped.fm/&quot;&gt;discuss.bootstrapped.fm&lt;/a&gt; and see if anyone has been discussing or working on your problem. There are also communities aiming to support building projects in public. Two notable examples are &lt;a href=&quot;https://wip.chat/&quot;&gt;WIP.chat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://getmakerlog.com/&quot;&gt;MakerLog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/&quot;&gt;ProductHunt&lt;/a&gt; is a good bet to look for launched projects. See if they are alive. &lt;em&gt;Bonus tip:&lt;/em&gt; For any existing project you find add ‚Äú/open‚Äù at the end of the URL, to see if you find an &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/what-is-an-open-statistics-page-and-why-you-should-have-one/&quot;&gt;open statistics page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check the crowdfunding platforms &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/&quot;&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiegogo.com/&quot;&gt;Indiegogo&lt;/a&gt; to see if there have been any projects solving the problem. Keep it broad - changing or extending a business model happens fairly quickly these days. Interesting metrics here are the funding status: Is the project overfunded or not founded at all? How many people backed the idea? Check any related project websites for engagement signs such as comments, links to YouTube videos with comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/&quot;&gt;HackerNews&lt;/a&gt; is a niche website and worth a look, if your idea is in the tech space. The search form is at the bottom of the website here. Interesting are the projects mentioned under ‚ÄúShow HN‚Äù, these are launched projects. If you find a project which solves a part of your problem you might want to add them to the competitors list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your project idea is a software project, it might be a good call to research on GitHub as well. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; is a platform where many software engineers share code and even complete projects. Maybe someone is building a project solving a similar problem and there is an option to cooperate or building on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the research done on the platforms above should give you a fairly good idea of the interest in a solution around your idea. If you stumbled across a ‚Äúno-go‚Äù such as a competitor, you might want to reconsider this. Competitors don‚Äôt mean your idea isn‚Äôt good, it means that it‚Äôs good enough for someone to pursue it. If there are established players, even better. This means there is enough money to sustain these companies generated by the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Diving even deeper into validating your idea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven‚Äôt given up along the way and reached this point, congratulations! You have gained a much deeper knowledge about the market your idea is addressing. You learned how the problem is currently solved, what your typical customer looks like and what tools exist at the moment. This is a great base to dive deeper into research and identify more deeply how your potential market looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following ideas and thoughts are based on a list of similar projects (called ‚ÄúCompetitors‚Äù in the template). It makes sense to check the website URL of each potential competitor for similar projects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neil Patel‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://neilpatel.com/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; has a free tool allowing you to assess your competitors&#39; backlinks and thereby their popularity. The key metrics are displayed on top. High numbers indicate more successful website and probably businesses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Search for alternatives on Google using ‚Äúalternative‚Äù + name. This way you can discover more similar projects as well as learn about which platforms discuss these alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check the Google index by searching for ‚Äúsite:URL‚Äù to see how many pages Google has indexed. This gives you a feel of the complexity behind the project as well as leading you to other interesting insights such as engineering blogs discussing issues &amp;amp; solutions, and an impression of the types of content the business is publishing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://app.buzzsumo.com/research/content&quot;&gt;Buzzsumo&lt;/a&gt; has built a handy tool to check how many social media shares a website has. Enter your competitors URL to see how actively their audience (customers) engages with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are several name-checking tools out there. These helpers verify the availability of usernames and domains. Often you might find similar projects if you try to find the right name for your side-project. Of course, my choice here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://startupnamecheck.com/&quot;&gt;Startup Name Check&lt;/a&gt;. For the competitors these might bring up stale projects or parked domains. These can indicate someone worked on a similar idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for niche communities regarding your topic. Check what issues they are discussing. Carefully check how the customers present and describe themselves. Profiles on these niche communities can be very interesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run a &lt;a href=&quot;https://smallseotools.com/backlink-checker/&quot;&gt;backlink search&lt;/a&gt; for the communities in your ‚ÄúSpaces‚Äù list. Keep an eye on articles linking to the communities as these often discuss solutions. Websites with questions as titles are usually a good bet for this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now you must know the market you are looking at very well. Your research might have brought up information which makes you doubt the idea is a good pick and that‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs wiser to spend the time identifying that it‚Äôs not a great idea than investing your time and money and finding it out along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What now?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully your research shows that your idea solves an existing problem and people are excited about having a solution for the problem. It‚Äôs much easier to build a business for excited users (who even search for a solution) than having to educate people that they have a problem they didn&#39;t realize before, which you are addressing and asking them to pay for on top of it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the market research steps above, you should know how people feel about the problem your idea is addressing. You should know what people‚Äôs time is consumed with and what they spend their money on. All great insights for the future of your project and will, without a doubt, help you to make sure your startup is set for success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Discussing your business idea privately&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about your idea seems against logic at first. Why tell anyone about your amazing new project you are planning? The reasons are simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other people know many things you might have missed. These can be things you simply failed to notice because you haven‚Äôt thought about it or which were lost on you due a bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others might know about a competitor or factors which makes it harder to monetize your project in the long run. As mentioned before, competitors alone aren‚Äôt a reason to throw in the towel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation itself will give you a great deal of insight as to what approach works for people, how they currently solve the problem, and how much the pain is worth for these users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you find a simple approach to having such a conversation with a potential client or user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively to doing this at this point, you can also reach out to individuals as you find good candidates during the first phase. The results might differ slightly as you gain and incorporate knowledge as you learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to verify your idea in a customer conversation?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a simple structure for a conversation with a user or customer. It includes all high-level points to ask as well as what to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Begin with a problem statement you are hoping to address and continue with a walk through of your suggested solution to address the problem. Conclude with an open-ended question &lt;em&gt;‚ÄòWhat do you think about this?‚Äô&lt;/em&gt;. In the following listen carefully to the response and look out for praise as well as criticism. Most people are usually voicing more positive statements than critic. Missing criticism doesn‚Äôt mean there is nothing wrong, it might be not openly spoken about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue by asking what the user or customer absolutely loves about the solution you are intending to build. Don‚Äôt forget to take notes, as this can be helpful to find out what you should focus on during development. Do the same for what they don‚Äôt like about it. You should watch out if people complain about the same issues repeatedly. These points might be worth improving on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúWhat do you think could be made better about the idea?‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;. This question helps you to maybe identify a related issue, which you might not have considered so far. These are interesting for the product roadmap later on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask which features the user or customer finds missing in the idea. Again, do the same for features they would remove, if they could. Both give you more information on what is important for the user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The final question before thanking them for their support and ending the conversation is to ask &lt;em&gt;‚ÄúIf they would recommend the solution to friends and workmates‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;. This shows you how the whole idea was perceived. No one would recommend to their friends something they don‚Äôt consider ‚Äògood‚Äô or ‚Äòworthy‚Äô.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally you write the questions out in a Google Doc as you would like to ask them before starting the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who should I talk to?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This depends on your idea and industry. The following ideas should lead you in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winning secret repeatedly mentioned by successful entrepreneurs is talking to your customers. You don‚Äôt have to wait until you have your product ready. From your ‚ÄúPeople‚Äù list anyone fitting the category ‚Äúpotential user‚Äù is a candidate. Also approach industry experts, such as authors and bloggers you have encountered regularly during the first phase of the research. It‚Äôs always a good call to include some other entrepreneurs. Don‚Äôt worry about them stealing your idea. Entrepreneurs are very busy with their own ideas and companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you are done with 5-10 conversation it makes sense to move into a public idea validation. A recommended approach using a landing page as well as public conversations is explained in the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Validating the idea with a landing page&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple landing page with a newsletter form allows you to collect email address for a later launch as well as gauge the interest in your solution. Describe briefly what solution you are addressing and leave some contact details as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://carrd.co/&quot;&gt;Carrd&lt;/a&gt; is a great tool for exactly this purpose. It allows you to build a simple one-page website for your project. The ‚ÄúPro‚Äù package for $9 per year allows you to have a form to collect email addresses using a free &lt;a href=&quot;https://mailchimp.com/&quot;&gt;Mailchimp&lt;/a&gt; account as well as a custom domain, which is great for your later launch as you can collect backlinks early on. It comes with a Google Analytics as well. You can find a suitable custom domain name by entering your keywords / key-phrases in my previously mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;https://startupnamecheck.com/&quot;&gt;name check tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Discussing your idea publicly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally you introduce your idea in a post on the places you find your potential customers/users. This might be a forum or on a social media website such as Facebook groups or a reddit. Your list of ‚ÄúSpaces &amp;amp; Links‚Äù should help to identify the right places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post itself should start with a short intro about yourself, explaining that you are doing research and then jump directly to the problem you are working on and the solution you are proposing. Pro tip: Make sure to include a link to your landing page and mention the newsletter at the end of each post. This way, you build up a mailing list of interested people as you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It usually pays off to post your idea on above mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiehackers.com/&quot;&gt;IndieHackers&lt;/a&gt; and in a Twitter thread. For the latter, a sizable audience or support by an established entrepreneur can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can You Actually Validate a Business Idea?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Validation an idea surely has its place. Yet, in the end there is only one 100% bulletproof method to validate an idea: The market. Only after building, launching and operating a project you will know if the idea is &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; viable as a business. Jason Fried put it well in a response to a similar question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Q: How do you discover and validate your ideas and how do you assess if an idea is worth executing? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/askJF?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#askJF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hiasinho?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@hiasinho&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/JsJpKKIEuO&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/JsJpKKIEuO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Jason Fried (@jasonfried) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jasonfried/status/1337095209620946944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;December 10, 2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this, it&#39;s time to conclude the research and get going - either on validing the idea more or jumping into action and start building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are quite a few steps and probably keep even experienced users of most of the mentioned platforms busy for a few days. That‚Äôs intended. As mentioned at the beginning, your ‚Äújob‚Äù as an entrepreneur is turning uncertainty into certainty. These are the steps to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also consider the research work as an investment. It‚Äôs an investment into knowing your market, knowing your customers and knowing your competitors. It‚Äôs also a massive driver of motivation once you have found out your idea is viable to be turned into a business supporting you in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you liked this deep dive don&#39;t forget to bookmark it. It would also be awesome if you could share it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Deep%20Dive%20into%20Validating%20Your%20Business%20Idea%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fpeterthaleikis.com%2Fbusiness-idea-validation%2F&amp;via=spekulatius1984&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://peterthaleikis.com/business-idea-validation/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. Thank you! üôèÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Where from here?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next logical step is, against logic, not building a product. The next step is marketing your idea. Drive traffic to your landing page and continue talking about it. Build a roadmap and make a call on what you need for a minimum viable product (MVP). For this, another post I‚Äôve written about building a project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/indie-hackers:-should-i-build-my-side-project-small-business-in-public/&quot;&gt;one tool at a time&lt;/a&gt;, might come in handy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What Is an Open Statistics Page and Why You Should Have One?</title>
    <link href="https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/what-is-an-open-statistics-page-and-why-you-should-have-one/"/>
    <updated>2020-01-09T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/what-is-an-open-statistics-page-and-why-you-should-have-one/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Online business in 2020 isn&#39;t what it was in 2000, or even just a few years ago. Things are changing. The old idea of companies being closed, unapproachable entities is coming to an end slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While for bigger and especially for publicly-listed companies some legal requirements to publish certain information existed for a long time, nothing similar exists for small businesses. For some companies, no legal requirement will ever be needed. They decided freely to publicly share company metrics from website visitors to revenue, earnings, churn and sometimes even wages online, in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why should I share my statistics openly?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correct and trustworthy information is key in our data-driven society. One annual report per year is not building up lots of trust nor is it a prime example of transparency. In our time and the online space, you should be able to do better. It doesn&#39;t need to be real-time but close to real-time updates help to build much more trust than annual or even monthly updates. This means you will need to develop this functionality - but this doesn&#39;t only come in handy for building public trust in your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing months in terms of revenue, number of users and other derived metrics such as revenue per user are great topics. Nothing is as big a &amp;quot;yaaay&amp;quot;-moment as the first paying customer. It also is a great base to start a more data-driven approach to building your project. With this you start to follow ‚ÄúOnly what gets measured, gets managed‚Äù. You can identify and discuss metrics in the context of your recent changes. This comes in handy if you are building your product or project in public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How is it done usually?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It became common practice to have a subpage under your root domain called &amp;quot;open&amp;quot;. For example, if your project is called &amp;quot;mySaaS&amp;quot; and runs under the domain name &amp;quot;https://mySaaS.com&amp;quot; the open statistics page would be &amp;quot;https://mySaaS.com/open&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, some companies choose to use a sub-domain. This means the URL above would be &lt;em&gt;https://open.mySaas.com&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;https://mySaaS.com/open&lt;/em&gt;. From a SEO point of view, a page on &lt;em&gt;https://mySaaS.com/open&lt;/em&gt; is preferable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What data to share? Which one to exclude?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s up to your discretion which information you like to share. The more information you share regularly, the more goodwill and trust you will build up. Typical examples include DAU (daily active users), revenue and earnings as well as visitor statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Avoid vanity metrics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanity metrics are usually metrics which aren&#39;t presented correctly or are presented in the wrong context. Wikipedia defines them as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup#Actionable_metrics&quot;&gt;opposite of actionable metrics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, the result of vanity metrics is making the numbers look better by accumulating instead of putting them into a time frame. A typical example is &amp;quot;absolute number of posts&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;number of posts per day&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, vanity metrics can actually be useful, but that&#39;s rather an exception than a rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Great examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffer is, without doubt, an exceptional company in many ways, that includes transparency as well. Not just the revenue and user statistics are public. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.buffer.com/salary-formula/&quot;&gt;salaries and the salary formula&lt;/a&gt; are too. The company is &lt;em&gt;defaulting to transparent&lt;/em&gt;, if possible. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://buffer.com/about#Transparency&quot;&gt;Buffer&#39;s company page&lt;/a&gt; contains several aspects the company is reporting on openly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More great examples can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiehackers.com/products/&quot;&gt;IndieHackers product list&lt;/a&gt; as well as on &lt;a href=&quot;https://baremetrics.com/open-startups&quot;&gt;baremetrics open startups&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing your statistics might feel strange at the beginning. Some might even say it&#39;s scary, but with transparency comes more accountability and trust. Young companies such as Buffer and NomadList are leading the way. You should consider following them and sharing more data of your business and lay the foundation for becoming a truly data-driven company. If you liked this article it would be awesome if you could share it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=What%20is%20an%20open%20statistics%20page%20and%20why%20you%20should%20have%20one.%0A%0Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fpeterthaleikis.com%2Fposts%2Fwhat-is-an-open-statistics-page-and-why-you-should-have-one%2F&amp;amp;via=spekulatius1984&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/what-is-an-open-statistics-page-and-why-you-should-have-one/&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; üôèÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you are still at the early stages and figuring out how to get started with a website that&#39;s not a problem at all. There are plenty of very good, easy, and cost-efficient options to get started with a website. A simple &amp;quot;landing page&amp;quot;-type marketed right can do miracles. One pretty decent option to get started quickly is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buildthis.io/review/siteground-hosting/&quot;&gt;WordPress site hosted on SiteGround&lt;/a&gt;. The review linked gives you all the details you need to know before getting started. Don&#39;t forget to build an open statistics page too üí™Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Project #5: Naming Tools</title>
    <link href="https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/project-5:-naming-tools/"/>
    <updated>2020-02-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/project-5:-naming-tools/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Not all &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/tags/side-projects&quot;&gt;side-projects&lt;/a&gt; need to lead directly to a business. Some might just be an experiment, a tool to build upon as mentioned in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/indie-hackers:-should-i-build-my-side-project-small-business-in-public/&quot;&gt;other article&lt;/a&gt; or a simple helper for yourself. Coding can be relaxing for some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the recent Christmas break I wanted to work on a project idea freely ‚Äî without the pressure to produce something to make money. &lt;a href=&quot;https://naming-tools.com/&quot;&gt;Naming Tools&lt;/a&gt; is the result. It&#39;s a simple website/tool to apply some (for me) new tech, try a different approach and solve a partial problem along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naming Tools is a fork of some ideas which I&#39;m using indirectly in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://startupnamecheck.com/&quot;&gt;name check tool&lt;/a&gt;. The Word Safety Tool is planned to provide little warnings on Startup Name Check. It will show you if you are using a domain name or username which might be considered profane in a different language or context. This happens, often unintentionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the tool is well-rounded with these additional tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://naming-tools.com/definitions&quot;&gt;Word definitions&lt;/a&gt; to find second/other meanings of any given term,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://naming-tools.com/rhymes&quot;&gt;Rhymes&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://naming-tools.com/synonyms&quot;&gt;Synonyms&lt;/a&gt; to identify alternatives for your planned project names and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://naming-tools.com/word-merge&quot;&gt;Word Merge&lt;/a&gt; to create portmanteau words as project names&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are coming from third-party services. You can find more details on the projects &#39;about&#39; page.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Project #6: Mail Merge for Linux Bash</title>
    <link href="https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/mail-merge-for-linux/"/>
    <updated>2020-02-24T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/mail-merge-for-linux/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, I get the feeling that not everything I build needs to be a commercial project. While sustainability is an issue, I still believe there is a realm for free and open-source projects. In some cases, the core value provided by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/tags/side-projects/&quot;&gt;side project&lt;/a&gt; doesn&#39;t justify the additional work to add payments and the required management infrastructure behind it. Naturally, this leads to a project with less features. But that&#39;s fine with me, as I want to solve only a particular problem and don&#39;t aim to build an all-encompassing solution with all the whistles and bells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative path instead of monetizing the project is simply open-sourcing it. This way others can profit from the work done and give back in other forms (e.g. sponsorship, etc.). Open sourcing the source code allows me to disconnect from the feeling I need to make a quick buck from it. Instead, you can give it away for anyone to use and eventually profit in other forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my latest little project, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/spekulatius/linux-bash-mail-merge&quot;&gt;Mail Merge for Linux Bash&lt;/a&gt;, I&#39;m following exactly this. With this project I cared really only about one core: feature merging emails and sending them. Existing services are too feature-rich. I wanted something very simple without monthly running costs. So I&#39;ve built myself a helper script to load a CSV file and fill in a template before triggering a &lt;code&gt;mailto:&lt;/code&gt; in Firefox. Chrome should work as well. The project is free for anyone to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What you need&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the project itself doesn&#39;t have any direct dependencies, your system will need to fulfill some basic requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux with bash CLI. I&#39;ve not tried any other environments, but there is a chance it works on systems of a similar nature (e.g. MacOS). Windows might work, I can&#39;t tell as I can&#39;t test it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;x-www-browser&lt;/code&gt; to be set to your browser. You can adjust this using the command &lt;code&gt;sudo update-alternatives --config x-www-browser&lt;/code&gt;. This is usually already done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A browser supporting &lt;code&gt;mailto:&lt;/code&gt;-URLs being executed and directed to your email provider. &lt;a href=&quot;https://getfirefox.com/&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; 73 does this by default. You can test this by clicking this link: &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:test@test.com&quot;&gt;mailto:test@test.com&lt;/a&gt;. If your email inbox opens with a new email you are good to go. This might require an additional confirmation when you are using this for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHP 7.4 or newer. This will be raised as PHP versions go out of support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fill in your CSV file and name it &lt;code&gt;targets.csv&lt;/code&gt;. You can define any number of headers within the file and use them in your template. You should always have at least the following headers: &lt;code&gt;Subject&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Email&lt;/code&gt; as the script uses these two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write your template file and name it &lt;code&gt;template.txt&lt;/code&gt;. Within the template file you can use any headers defined in the CSV file. The subject line should always be the first line of the template, followed by two line breaks and should start with &lt;code&gt;Subject:&lt;/code&gt;. Please note that you should use all headers in capital letters within the template file. So, &lt;code&gt;Email&lt;/code&gt; would be transformed to &lt;code&gt;EMAIL&lt;/code&gt; automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;php generate.php&lt;/code&gt; to trigger the merge of the content and the related &lt;code&gt;mailto:&lt;/code&gt; commands. You might need to allow these actions to be triggering your provider email (e.g. Gmail).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While working on fine-tuning your template and testing the headers it might pay off to use only one or two lines in your CSV. Once everything is in order, you can run the whole data set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it. No magic involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to get it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply clone the repository using this command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;git clone git@github.com:spekulatius/linux-bash-mail-merge.git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Support&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>How to generate a Laravel sitemap dynamically?</title>
    <link href="https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/how-to-generate-a-laravel-sitemap-dynamically/"/>
    <updated>2020-03-24T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/how-to-generate-a-laravel-sitemap-dynamically/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;What is a sitemap?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitemaps are xml-files containing structured data about the pages of the website. Each page has an entry similar to this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-xml&quot;&gt;  &amp;lt;url&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;loc&amp;gt;https://startupnamecheck.com&amp;lt;/loc&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;lastmod&amp;gt;2020-03-06T20:31:03+00:00&amp;lt;/lastmod&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;priority&amp;gt;0.9&amp;lt;/priority&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;changefreq&amp;gt;monthly&amp;lt;/changefreq&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/url&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What are sitemaps good for?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitemaps are helpers for search-engines to discover all relevant pages and content on a website. While there are also sitemaps for images, the focus here is on web-pages only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How can I generate a sitemap?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sitemap can be created in various ways. If you are using a framework such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://laravel.com/&quot;&gt;Laravel&lt;/a&gt; you can create these on the fly or whenever you publish or update your content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some experiments and checking several solutions on GitHub I&#39;ve not found the solution I was looking for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A simple, permanent crawler of the actual website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It considers &lt;code&gt;noindex&lt;/code&gt; robots tags as well as canonicals and of course the &lt;code&gt;article:modified_time&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignores JavaScript as Google does mostly. This allows it to run much faster than executing a headless browser only to access a pure HTML5/CSS3 page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My solution for sitemaps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, after some research I haven&#39;t found what I had in mind. So, being a developer at heart, I&#39;ve opted to build my own solution. It&#39;s heavily reliant on &lt;a href=&quot;https://mvdbos.github.io/php-spider/&quot;&gt;PHP Spider&lt;/a&gt;, a crawler package for PHP. Besides this, the package is using some regex to identify the most interesting parts of the website. Other values, such as &lt;code&gt;priority&lt;/code&gt; are guessed by the depth within the website (nesting level). More detail can also be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bringyourownideas/laravel-sitemap&quot;&gt;GitHub repo for Laravel-Sitemaps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How can I get this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The package is distributed using &lt;a href=&quot;https://getcomposer.org/&quot;&gt;composer&lt;/a&gt; and can be installed using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;composer require bringyourownideas/laravel-sitemap
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will automatically configure the required Laravel ServiceProvider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to use the package&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The package registers an &lt;code&gt;artisan&lt;/code&gt;-command called &lt;code&gt;sitemap:generate&lt;/code&gt;. This triggers a crawl of your site and writing out of the sitemap. For convenience, you can add this to your deployment steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Regular updates of the sitemap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;d like to run updates of the &lt;code&gt;sitemap.xml&lt;/code&gt; regularly, you can add a new line in &lt;code&gt;app/Console/Kernel.php&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;schedule&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;/**
 * Define the application&#39;s command schedule.
 *
 * @param  \Illuminate\Console\Scheduling\Schedule  $schedule
 * @return void
 */
protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
{
    $schedule-&amp;gt;command(&#39;sitemap:generate&#39;)-&amp;gt;daily();

    // ...or with a defined time...

    $schedule-&amp;gt;command(&#39;sitemap:generate&#39;)-&amp;gt;daily()-&amp;gt;at(&#39;02:50&#39;);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary &amp;amp; Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve got issues please raise an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bringyourownideas/laravel-sitemap/issues&quot;&gt;issue on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Laptop Life Savers</title>
    <link href="https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/laptop-life-savers/"/>
    <updated>2020-04-02T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/laptop-life-savers/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A little different post than my side-project or coding-related stories. Don&#39;t worry it&#39;s not about the Chinese virus Covid19, at least not directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been using the Lenovo X1 series since my time in New Zealand. It&#39;s an amazing light laptop with great support for &lt;a href=&quot;https://elementary.io/&quot;&gt;elementary OS&lt;/a&gt;. The current one is my third one. The first one was employer-issued and the second I gave to my partner so she has a decent machine. All machines have been second-hand as I believe in recycling and reusing things as much as possible to reduce my impact on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Number 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number 3 made a little bit of fan-noise for a while. It&#39;s been like this since I bought the second-hand Lenovo X1 from &lt;a href=&quot;https://second-it.de/&quot;&gt;Second IT&lt;/a&gt; in Germany. I&#39;ve been unable to use the warranty as I left Germany again just two days after the laptop got delivered. I&#39;ve also not seen it as an issue as the fan barely ran anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two days ago the laptop fan started to make more and more noise until it stopped. And my heart also missed a few beats. Having built and used computers for a while I know this could mean a quick death. With the current Corona-times and being in locked-down Georgia (the country, not the US state) with all non-essential shops closed, entry-ban for foreigners and almost all flights cancelled, it&#39;s quite a stressfactor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No Local Lenovo Support&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The local Lenovo store was of little help: No English speaker was to be found at the time I called. Maybe due to the quarantine. Travelling to the store didn&#39;t seem to make much sense - almost all shops are closed these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online research didn&#39;t bring much on the chances to get a replacement part delivered. Calling Second IT, the shop I had purchased the laptop from, was great: The team promised to find a fan and even ship it to Georgia to help me out in my stressful situation. A little light at the end of the tunnel, you could say. I agreed to visit one local store beforehand. A local laptop repair center called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/LaptopCenterPRO&quot;&gt;Laptop Centre&lt;/a&gt; here in Tbilisi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team at the Laptop Centre was very friendly and offered to look at my laptop within an hour. I&#39;d barely made my way towards the city when I got a call: My laptop is working again, but the fan is still making some noise. I should come and check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/static/images/Laptop-Life-Savers/hardware-art.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Clock as Hardware Art in the Laptop Centre&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the store they explained to me that the fan was still not working properly and should be replaced. But it was working for now. As the problem wasn&#39;t 100% fixed I was not charged anything - even with a working laptop in my hands. My tip was strongly denied. Georgian hospitality at its best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chatted a bit about coding (what else?), &lt;a href=&quot;https://vuejs.org/&quot;&gt;VueJS&lt;/a&gt; and he mentioned that he is a backend developer as well. He built an online payment wallet for Georgia called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oppa.ge/en&quot;&gt;Oppa&lt;/a&gt;! Pretty impressive for the age of 23! I can&#39;t say I built similar-sized projects at this age!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Replacement Fan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The replacement fan is ordered and will arrive hopefully soon. I&#39;m quite happy to have found so many helping hands when it was needed. Hence my wish to share a little uplifting story!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Where To Post your Startup, Side-Project or App?</title>
    <link href="https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/where-to-post-your-startup-side-project-or-app/"/>
    <updated>2020-04-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/where-to-post-your-startup-side-project-or-app/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Marketing is a challenge. Everyone who has built anything on the web knows that. I&#39;ve watched many great projects go under due to their makers and founders not knowing the basics of getting it noticed. I&#39;ve spent much of last year learning content marketing and am still on it. I&#39;m not claiming to have the ultimate recipe for overnight success, but I know that putting yourself and your idea out there regularly helps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In supporting those who build a startup, project, app, wherever, I&#39;ve decided to create a simple regular email newsletter sharing places and chances to promote your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why a Newsletter Instead of Just a List?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large list with numerous places to submit is great - but only to rank on Google. But when you are working through, it gets frustrating very quickly. Websites are either not free anymore, dead or not accepting new submissions. Often details are missing. The quality of these lists declines dramatically with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, even if you find a few good sites to promote your work on, you are likely to give up after a few hours of non-stop filling in forms, confirming your email address, etc. The effect is low as there is no regularity. A newsletter makes it much easier: You get it, read over it briefly and decide if it&#39;s a fit and worth your time. This leads to working more regularly on the marketing side of your projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is it free?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no plans to charge anything for the newsletter. Any help in the form of hints or curating information is highly appreciated though. Please get in touch using the contact option here on my blog üí™Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Frequently Do You Send These?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This depends a lot on my other commitments. I&#39;m not planning on sending dozens of emails a week. That&#39;s not me and wouldn&#39;t help. I plan to send one decent email every two weeks rather than twenty small emails a day. This being said, if a time-critical opportunity arises I might send out a short email instead of missing out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can I See an Example? üîçÔ∏è&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, I&#39;ve prepared an example for a newsletter showing the key insights for &lt;a href=&quot;https://buttondown.email/where-to-post/archive/launching-on-product-hunt/&quot;&gt;launching on ProductHunt&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://buttondown.email/where-to-post/archive/marketing-on-reddit/&quot;&gt;marketing on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. The detailed structure might change as time passes - I&#39;m open to any constructive feedback of course üôåÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sounds Great, Where Can I Subscribe?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head over to &lt;a href=&quot;https://wheretopost.email/#subscribe&quot;&gt;Where To Post&lt;/a&gt; and subscribe. Any help promoting the newsletter is of course appreciated! Please share it on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?via=spekulatius1984&amp;amp;url=https://wheretopost.email&amp;amp;text=Where%20to%20post%20my%20side-project%2C%20startup%20or%20business%3F&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://wheretopost.email&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://wheretopost.email&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; or wherever you think it fits :) Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nova Spatie Backup: Keeps spinning / 422 error: &quot;This disk is not configured as a backup disk.&quot;</title>
    <link href="https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/nova-spatie-backup:-keeps-spinning-422-error:-%22this-disk-is-not-configured-as-a-backup-disk.%22/"/>
    <updated>2020-04-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/nova-spatie-backup:-keeps-spinning-422-error:-%22this-disk-is-not-configured-as-a-backup-disk.%22/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Spatie&#39;s Laravel Components are surely known to most and are great helpers to build any kind of Laravel application or website. I&#39;ve been using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/spatie/laravel-backup&quot;&gt;Laravel Backup component&lt;/a&gt; on my projects. With my recent shift to &lt;a href=&quot;https://nova.laravel.com/&quot;&gt;Laravel Nova&lt;/a&gt; on my new project &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitesizedinsights.com/&quot;&gt;BiteSizedInsights.com&lt;/a&gt;, I&#39;ve started to look at the related &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/spatie/nova-backup-tool&quot;&gt;Nova component&lt;/a&gt;. It worked fine, once I got over some initial trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once completed installing Spatie Backups, I&#39;ve run a &lt;code&gt;artisan backup:run&lt;/code&gt; to see if it works: local backups worked as to expect and are considered &amp;quot;healthy&amp;quot;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/static/images/How-to-fix-Laravel-Nova-This-disk-is-not-configured-as-a-backup-disk/working.png&quot; alt=&quot;local backups are working&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, I&#39;ve continued to set up B2 as my cloud filesystem and backup solution. The setup of &lt;a href=&quot;https://bringyourownideas.com/blog/backing-up-your-laravel-project-to-backblaze-b2/&quot;&gt;B2 as your Laravel backup system&lt;/a&gt; is easy and done in a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, I&#39;ve installed the Nova component for Laravel backups using composer: &lt;code&gt;composer require spatie/nova-backup-tool&lt;/code&gt; and configured the tools as explained. While checking the Nova admin interface I&#39;ve noticed that it isn&#39;t working as expected. The loading icons kept spinning without any data showing up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/static/images/How-to-fix-Laravel-Nova-This-disk-is-not-configured-as-a-backup-disk/nova-backup-error-spinning.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Nova loading error&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After checking the Firefox browser console I&#39;ve noticed an odd HTTP-422 request with this message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/static/images/How-to-fix-Laravel-Nova-This-disk-is-not-configured-as-a-backup-disk/422-request.png&quot; alt=&quot;422 Request&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message contained an error message, which I&#39;ve not seen on the admin-panel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;This disk is not configured as a backup disk.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some research in the code, I&#39;ve found out this error was caused by a small misconfiguration in the &lt;code&gt;config/backup.php&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/static/images/How-to-fix-Laravel-Nova-This-disk-is-not-configured-as-a-backup-disk/Nova-Backup-Misconfiguration.png&quot; alt=&quot;Nova-Backup Misconfiguration&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I&#39;ve set this to B2 the backup overview &amp;amp; creation worked as expected:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How I force myself to work</title>
    <link href="https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/how-i-force-myself-to-work/"/>
    <updated>2020-04-21T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/how-i-force-myself-to-work/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;No one seems to be immune to procrastinating, myself included. Some people get drawn into social media, for others it&#39;s YouTube or ProductHunt. I, however, tend to lose whole days on Wikipedia and development communities. Everyone has their poison. If you really are one of these odd people who don&#39;t know what procrastination is, check out this video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/arj7oStGLkU&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got distracted again while you should have finished that project? You are in the right place. Keep on reading! After trying numerous ways to keep myself coding or writing, I&#39;ve finally found something that works for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hard cut: &amp;quot;/etc/hosts&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;127.0.0.1&amp;quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while I&#39;ve used custom entries in my hosts file &lt;code&gt;/etc/hosts&lt;/code&gt; redirecting some DNS requests to my local machine to die there. It&#39;s hard 404 to remind myself that I got distracted again and broke the flow. This worked well, but occasionally I had to find a solution to a coding issue and had to switch particular sites off. It became a habit of switching off the whole list as it was easier. And that is where old habits got the best of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Breaking Procrastination using a browser extension&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are numerous browser extensions aiming to help victims of their habits like myself with their problem. Most of these didn&#39;t win me over as they either limited my browser too much or were simply not thought through enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deprocrastination.co/&quot;&gt;deprocrastination.co&lt;/a&gt; extension did a much better job here. I loved the ability to control access to certain sites and have dedicated blocks of effort. It worked well until the point I simply had to use one of the sites that were included in my block list. I had to break the timer or exclude the site manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another little annoyance was that YouTube, my source of background music, was usually running. It wasn&#39;t affected by the extension as long as I didn&#39;t switch to the tab accidentally. My habit of jumping around my browser tabs using keyboard shortcuts got me into trouble regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Managing &amp;quot;/etc/hosts&amp;quot; version 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a regular reader of Mattias Geniar&#39;s Newsletter &lt;a href=&quot;https://ma.ttias.be/cronweekly/&quot;&gt;cron.weekly&lt;/a&gt;, I&#39;ve recently discovered a neat command-line tool to manage your &amp;quot;/etc/hosts&amp;quot;-file better: &lt;a href=&quot;https://guumaster.github.io/hostctl/&quot;&gt;hostctl&lt;/a&gt;! It allows you to predefine sets of host entries and to switch them on and off using commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;# This will enable the blocks for mails by redirecting each domain to localhost.
hostctl enable nomail;

# This will disable the block and allow me to connect again.
hostctl disable nomail;

# Alternatively, you can use the toggle command:
hostctl toggle nomail;

# Note: I&#39;ve actually got aliases for both. Simply add it to your ~/.bash_aliases
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve added some five sets to my hosts file. The sets are grouped by topics, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/static/images/How-I-force-myself-to-work/hosts-example.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, I&#39;ve added another bash alias called &amp;quot;work&amp;quot;. It enables all block profiles at once and makes sure I keep working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I really need to access a site, I switch off the block for the set using an alias (for example &amp;quot;mail&amp;quot;) and run a &amp;quot;sleep 120; work&amp;quot; to keep myself from going down some rabbit hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Too technical for you?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this approach is too technical for you, you might want to check out the extension mentioned above. It&#39;s a great solution if hostctl is too technical and kept me on track for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this post or the video on top helped you to procrastinate it might be time to try either the extension or hostctl. Give it a try!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you struggle to make your projects work in general you might want to have a look at my &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/my-indie-hacker-rules/&quot;&gt;personal Indie Hacker Rules&lt;/a&gt; - a set of ideas how to push myself more. I&#39;ve also written about what I consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/what-makes-a-good-indie-hacker/&quot;&gt;good habits and traits for Indie Hackers&lt;/a&gt;. Both articles might be worth spending a few minutes on, if you made it until here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;The Problem: &amp;quot;Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes&amp;quot;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these issues you might stumble across using the PHP framework Laravel is this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some research, I&#39;ve found out it&#39;s coming up when using older versions of MySQL (prior to 5.7.8) or MariaDB (prior to 10.2.2). It was MariaDB in my case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solution #1:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Laravel this can be resolved simply by changing your app service provider configuration (in &lt;code&gt;app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php&lt;/code&gt;) with the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

public function boot()
{
    /**
     * Ensure we aren&#39;t running into `Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes`
     *
     * @see https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/laravel:-specified-key-was-too-long-max-key-length-is-767-bytes/
     **/
    Schema::defaultStringLength(191);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this you might need to rebuild your database using &lt;code&gt;php artisan migrate:fresh --seed&lt;/code&gt; - this will completely reset your database and start off fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solution #2:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also upgrade your database server. This hasn&#39;t been discussed here as it is very system-specific. DuckDuckGo is your friend üí™Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What makes a good Indie Hacker</title>
    <link href="https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/what-makes-a-good-indie-hacker/"/>
    <updated>2020-08-23T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/what-makes-a-good-indie-hacker/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mccormick.cx/&quot;&gt;Chris McCormick (chr15m)&lt;/a&gt; recently announced on Indie Hackers: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiehackers.com/post/holy-heck-this-is-hard-8ebe864174&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Holy heck this is hard&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; - and rightly so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being an indie hacker isn&#39;t as simple and easy as it&#39;s often presented online. It&#39;s not just putting a little MVP together over the weekend, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wheretopost.email/kb/submit/launching-on-producthunt.html&quot;&gt;submitting it in on ProductHunt&lt;/a&gt; and getting the cash flowing. It&#39;s mostly hard work without knowing if you&#39;ll end up with a winning product or not. It&#39;s having countless &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/business-idea-validation/&quot;&gt;doubts about your idea&lt;/a&gt;, how to market it and the product itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&#39;s doable and there are people who &amp;quot;win the indie hacker lottery&amp;quot; (lottery is a horrible word for it, btw). There are people building independent business without any external funding or other support every day. In fact, it is more common than CV funded businesses. I&#39;m following stories and reading (too many) books about them. You rarely find them in the places you would expect - it&#39;s the little shop owner down the street and the friendly hostel you stayed at on your trip last year. Over time, I&#39;ve come to see repetitive characteristics and behaviors which seem to enable success. Here are some of the qualities which make it easier (not easy) to be an indie hacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Being Scrappy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without VC funding, a complete team or for that matter any resource in abundance, you naturally have to get creative when it comes to solving problems. You can&#39;t give work to employees if you can&#39;t afford any and outsourcing much of your work isn&#39;t going to be much of an option until you have a stable revenue stream at least. You will need to come up with solutions for problems which make do with what you&#39;ve already got. Mostly this means you have work within your skill set and time limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This doesn&#39;t mean you do everything yourself though. For example, learning to develop mobile apps simply for one project isn&#39;t an efficient use of time in most cases - it would rather make sense to find a no-code builder for mobile apps to build a prototype. After the prototype has validated the idea and proved your market, it&#39;s time to consider finding a developer as a code founder or contractor - all to get to the goal with your existing skills and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Focus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large and externally-funded businesses usually have to split their focus between their goals and plans and the interests of the investors. For VC-founded companies, this often raises the question of aiming for growth or profit. As Paul Jarvis noted in &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/37570605-company-of-one&quot;&gt;Company of One&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;, doing both at the same time is incredibly hard and you have to make a call. You need to either align your goals or find a middle ground - which both take time and energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a super-small just-you business, you&#39;ve got only one primary goal: turning a profit to make your business sustainable. Nothing more or less. Great growth stories have to wait until you&#39;ve had a chance to establish your business and ensure you&#39;ve got a revenue stream to finance from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shouldn&#39;t have priorities, only a priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Speed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One aspect indie hackers have a unique advantage in is speed. As a solo-founder, you can change your product and add features at a speed no team could. You have no planning meetings to attend, no communications with team members, and of course no handovers between team members. All these save valuable time when it comes to delivering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further enabling your speedy turnarounds, you have in-depth knowledge of your product which allows you to deliver faster even than a team of numerous developers, designers and managers together can achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Innovation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovating is at the core of building an indie business. Without innovation you have to compete on price and price competition usually doesn&#39;t leave much in regards to profits. Only large and on-going investments make growth viable in industries facing strong pricing-competition. Not a space for indie hackers really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But innovation comes at a price: Research and development doesn&#39;t come for free and has inherently higher risks compared to doing the same over and over again. Risks aren&#39;t what larger organisations want: after all, they usually have strong established interests of stakeholders and investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indie Hackers have the freedom to take risks that aren&#39;t acceptable for established companies. You can experiment with a level of freedom which is unique. Use it wisely and find the unique ways to drive customers and profitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Connection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unique and authentic connections are an aspect no larger company can even achieve. You are one on one without customers, every time and every day. You have the chance to stand out by being authentic and create in a way people seek it, especially online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a company reaches a certain size and there are dedicated roles, authentic connection is naturally harder, especially with pressure to squeeze out the last bit of growth or profit. So skip formality and bring personality to the table as long as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting way to stand out is being more open. By sharing more insights you build a natural and authentic connection. An &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/what-is-an-open-statistics-page-and-why-you-should-have-one/&quot;&gt;open statistics page&lt;/a&gt; can be a great start for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What does this tell us?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, being an indie hacker is hard, no doubt. But it is worth bringing it into perspective before the Internet, it was much much harder and just 15 years ago pre-Stripe, pre-AWS and pre-GitHub it was much harder than today. I&#39;m not even talking about the computing power in your pocket exceeding the Apollo Missions navigation computers. And there is also the human aspect of it: If it was easy, everyone would do it. It needs to challenge us, otherwise we wouldn&#39;t consider it worthy to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Btw, if you are interested in thoughts like these you might also like to get &lt;a href=&quot;https://buttondown.email/spekulatius&quot;&gt;my newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. Just an idea üí™Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>My Indie Hacker Rules</title>
    <link href="https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/my-indie-hacker-rules/"/>
    <updated>2020-08-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/my-indie-hacker-rules/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you learn some &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; rules when you&#39;ve been doing something for a while. Being an indie hacker is no different. Over time, I&#39;ve identified these rules for my work on bootstrapped indie projects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects don&#39;t need to be complicated. Check out this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.producthunt.com/posts/newsletter-virtual-mall&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; - it&#39;s literally a Google Sheet and a domain. If you don&#39;t need to have a complex solution don&#39;t overcomplicate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I can build a better version of this in a weekend.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; never works out. I started to multiply my estimations by at least 3. For any larger unknown or new technology I can&#39;t just get out of my head, I add at least a factor one. Don&#39;t know how to do oAuth with this site? Plan another two days for reading yourself into the topic and getting it working properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wheretopost.email/&quot;&gt;Marketing &amp;gt; Building&lt;/a&gt;: If I&#39;m not willing to put at least 3-5 times the (actual!) development time into marketing, I &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/side-project-ideas-up-for-grabs/&quot;&gt;shelve the idea or give it away&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, that means &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I can build this in a weekend&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; turned already into full-time work over weeks by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because I can build it and it doesn&#39;t exist, doesn&#39;t mean I have to build. There are usually &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/business-idea-validation&quot;&gt;good reasons for it not to exist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I can do this better&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; is seldom worth rebuilding weeks of work someone else already invested. Generally: None of those million-dollar-over-a-weekend stories (which will never apply to you) show any of the years learning and preparing for overnight success. I don&#39;t believe them, I don&#39;t read/watch them. Rome wasn&#39;t built in a day and so this won&#39;t be a successful project. Sure, there are exceptions - but the exception isn&#39;t doing more than showing the underlying rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only do projects I can and will &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food&quot;&gt;dogfood*&lt;/a&gt; myself. It simply doesn&#39;t make any sense to build something you aren&#39;t even using yourself. How are you going to find out if your features are really solving the problem? Plus motivation is going to fall flat in the long run until you get your first customers, if you aren&#39;t having any direct benefit from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to admit it: If a project isn&#39;t live when the reminder-email for the annual domain renewal arrives in my inbox, it&#39;s dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love to find the &lt;a href=&quot;https://startupnamecheck.com/&quot;&gt;right name and snap up the domains&lt;/a&gt; quickly. I&#39;ve even &lt;strong&gt;made&lt;/strong&gt; a project for exactly this! But I have to put on the brakes: No new domains until the old ones are put to use! #DomainersAnonymous&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-stop work isn&#39;t good. I need to go out frequently and ensure I actually move more than just going to the kitchen and getting another coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producing &amp;gt; Consuming: I get it, the Internet is a place full of shiny stuff with something for everyone. But let&#39;s be honest: consuming doesn&#39;t help in getting anything out of the door. It starts with the latest news/controversy/products/analytics or search console stats/growth-hacking ideas/________ - you name it. It also doesn&#39;t stop with the current live-stream of SpaceX launching again or with simply watching YouTube passively while coding - all of these are &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/how-i-force-myself-to-work/&quot;&gt;distracting you from achieving your goals&lt;/a&gt;. Sounds tough? Yeah, maybe, but I can&#39;t do any of these and be actually productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking &amp;quot;Yeah, but .....&amp;quot;? I&#39;m not saying I never watch YouTube or register a domain in overboiling excitement for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/tags/side-projects/&quot;&gt;new side-project&lt;/a&gt;. These are just my personal rules I &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; to live by. That&#39;s all üëçÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re interested in what I would consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/what-makes-a-good-indie-hacker/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; characteristics for IndieHackers&lt;/a&gt;, I wrote about this too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;= actually cookies. In case you are scrolling up to find the asterisk: it&#39;s on number six.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Brain Dump #1: Why Shortcuts Usually Don&#39;t Work</title>
    <link href="https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/brain-dump-1-why-shortcuts-usually-dont-work.html"/>
    <updated>2021-01-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/brain-dump-1-why-shortcuts-usually-dont-work.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m always surprised by people looking for the magic bullet to solve problems. Individuals are always on the lookout for the ultimate shortcut; the one trick no one is using that works like magic. Statements such as &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;If I had a shortcut to make this work...&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;If there was a quickerway on completing this task...&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; aren&#39;t unheard of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why is this so puzzling to me?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might sound strange at first, but I feel there is a natural law working against the idea of a shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s coming from a very basic idea: If there is a much quicker way to solve a problem or do some tasks (i.e.,the shortcut), then it wouldn&#39;t be a shortcut anymore. Everyone would do it and the shortcut would instantly become the regular way in which people solve a particular issue. the regular way people solve this particular issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So no shortcuts? What else then?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here comes the part that most people don&#39;t like. The actual solution: Hard work, persistence and being smart about it. Nothing beats working consistently on an issue, solving one little issue at a time and keep doing this over and over again. Success is nothing more than this.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brain Dump #2: The AI Future we are looking at</title>
    <link href="https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/brain-dump-2-the-ai-future-we-are-looking-at.html"/>
    <updated>2021-01-23T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/brain-dump-2-the-ai-future-we-are-looking-at.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2020/10/05/what-is-gpt-3-and-why-is-it-revolutionizing-artificial-intelligence/?sh=44925fcb481a&quot;&gt;GPT-3&lt;/a&gt; can already write, design and code. &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/&quot;&gt;DALL-E&lt;/a&gt; is generating images faster and more creative than any human ever could, at breakneck speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that&#39;s not enough to impress you, the next (or following) iteration will blow us all out of the water. Google has already trained the &lt;a href=&quot;https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/12/google-trained-a-trillion-parameter-ai-language-model/&quot;&gt;next generation model&lt;/a&gt; of a GPT model. Computing power gets cheaper and easier to access. From here on, AI will only become exponentially better and continue to outpace humans.&lt;br /&gt;
In a market economy, these AI-driven changes will drive the cost for writing and translations down to almost zero. Writing will become a hobby, not a human-dominated business. Same goes for web-design, a significant part of software development, etc. Many traditional human jobs will be eliminated and will turn into either a hobby or sport, depending on the type of activity. Check out this video from a couple of years back that had already predicted this.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brain dump #3: FOMO done right - a lesson learned from Clubhouse</title>
    <link href="https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/brain-dump-3-fomo-done-right-with-clubhouse.html"/>
    <updated>2021-01-26T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/brain-dump-3-fomo-done-right-with-clubhouse.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Clubhouse is the new kid on the block. It&#39;s a social media network... or maybe not. At the moment, it&#39;s not actually 100% sure what it actually is. I actually haven&#39;t tried it out. But in a conversation with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jens.marketing/&quot;&gt;friend who&#39;s a marketer&lt;/a&gt;, I&#39;ve already learned some interesting stuff about FOMO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who know me, know for sure I&#39;m not a fan of (over) hyped stuff. Yet, somehow Clubhouse managed to get through my radar. This is rather unusual. The hook? FOMO done well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s take a step back: &lt;a href=&quot;https://whichlogin.com/clubhouse/clubhouse-user-guide/&quot;&gt;How do events in Clubhouse work?&lt;/a&gt; They are live - same as Facebook or Twitter. No difference here. But what comes next is different. Or, to be more precise, what doesn&#39;t come next is interesting. You can&#39;t replay them. You can&#39;t record them (and aren&#39;t allowed to). There&#39;s no &amp;quot;we will upload it later to YouTube&amp;quot;. You&#39;re either there or you aren&#39;t. Full stop. In case you remember, it&#39;s kind of like in the pre-smartphone times - you were either there or you weren&#39;t. This is pure FOMO because you are actually missing out. No fake FOMO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way, you will take a notification about an event from your favorite creators much more seriously. Hardcore fans will definitely drop everything to join in. Very interesting! Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to Fix &quot;throw er; // Unhandled &#39;error&#39; event&quot;?</title>
    <link href="https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/how-to-fix-throw-er-unhandled-error-event.html"/>
    <updated>2022-07-23T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://peterthaleikis.com/posts/how-to-fix-throw-er-unhandled-error-event.html</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some errors are easy and simple. Quick fixes you get resolved in minutes. Others aren&#39;t and you got to dig in for much longer than you would like to. This was one of these for me. I&#39;m sharing my solution here to make it a bit easier for other developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This problem seems to affect especially Linux users like myself. I can&#39;t confirm this for sure as I run only Linux üêßÔ∏è On my &lt;a href=&quot;http://elementary.io/&quot;&gt;elementary&lt;/a&gt; the issue usually comes up when I try to run npm/yarn commands which are supposed to watch file changes (e.g. CSS/SCSS or JavaScript files). The problem affects all frameworks from VueJS, to React and Angular. The related &lt;code&gt;dev&lt;/code&gt;- and &lt;code&gt;prod&lt;/code&gt;-commands work fine. It&#39;s only affecting &lt;code&gt;watch&lt;/code&gt;-command and appears to be linked to a file-system incompatibility when watching file changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular case problem arises while using my swiss armyknife build tool Laravel Mix on a project. When running &lt;code&gt;npm run watch&lt;/code&gt; (actually &lt;code&gt;yarn watch&lt;/code&gt;) I get this error message &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the compile step is finish:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;events.js:292
      throw er; // Unhandled &#39;error&#39; event
      ^
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line number depends on the exact libraries used in the project, but the &lt;code&gt;events.js&lt;/code&gt; filename or &lt;code&gt;throw er; // unhandled &#39;error&#39; event&lt;/code&gt; are usually part of the error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If supported, &lt;code&gt;watch-poll&lt;/code&gt; often resolves the issue. But some libraries, like my starter for eleventy (this blog), aren&#39;t supporting poll and I needed to resort to a different approach. After spending some time researching and trying I&#39;ve found a solution which works for now. I remove the &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt;-folder (&lt;code&gt;rm -rf node_modules&lt;/code&gt;) and force-clear the NPM cache (&lt;code&gt;npm cache clear --force&lt;/code&gt;) before reinstalling the node dependencies. Summarized in the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json yarn.lock
npm cache clear --force
npm install
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note: This removes also the lock-file. Thereby updating your project, make sure to test everything before you push the changes to production üôèÔ∏è&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update #1: Solution: Stop all other &amp;quot;watch&amp;quot;-processes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a number of node processes running this might be part of your issue. I&#39;ve noticed the problem coming up more often if I&#39;ve got a number of watch processes (for other projects) running. After stopping these and clearing the files as described above the issues was resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update #2 (2020-03-04): Error: ENOSPC: System limit for number of file watchers reached, watch &#39;src/assets&#39;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a recent update of my dependencies, I&#39;ve noticed a new, better understandable wording for the known error. This points you much faster in the right direction. Again, I&#39;ve been able to resolve the issue using the approach mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update #3 (2020-04-23): Increase allowed file handles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By chance I stumbled across a solution to increase the number of allowed file handles. This actually came with my recent trail of Microsoft Studio Code for Linux. It thrown a familiar sounding error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Visual Studio Code is unable to watch for file changes in this large workspace (error ENOSPC)

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft recommended the following to increase the number of allowed file handles. You can do by updating your &lt;code&gt;/etc/sysctl.conf&lt;/code&gt; file. The detail steps are lined out &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux#_visual-studio-code-is-unable-to-watch-for-file-changes-in-this-large-workspace-error-enospc&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update #4: Do you prefer a video?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More a video guy? Someone also made a video based on the content of article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_GG9jgLgBXk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update #5:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might also come with a blocked port an app is try to listen to. In this case your error message might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;node:events:505 throw er; // unhandled &#39;error&#39; event ^ error: listen eaddrinuse: address already in use :::5000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The port at the end, here &lt;code&gt;5000&lt;/code&gt;, can vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this looks like your problem, you might want to check what is listening on the port in question. Simply open the port with port, e.g. &lt;code&gt;localhost:5000&lt;/code&gt;, in your browser. After turning of the application in question or changing your port this problem should be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;By the way&lt;/h2&gt;
